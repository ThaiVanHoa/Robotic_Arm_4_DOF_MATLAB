Real Time simulation of a Robotic Arm Using Solidworks For Conception And Matlab Simulink Simscape for Simulation

Using Matlab simulink + solidworks to simulate 7 dof robot forward kinematics


## Main Flow


This section shows the main steps I followed to achieve the goal.

   - first use solidworks to draw the links then assemble them together.
   - Install matlab simulink third guide to solve forward 
   - use solidworks to export robot.xml file.
  
         In matlab at the command window smimport('robot.xml').
 

  - Adapt The simulink slx file to what you need
  - finally create  robot interface control in matlab Grphical User Interface.
